# Production Ready Spring Boot Boilerplate
This repository provides a production ready boilerplate for Java Spring Boot applications, designed to save time when setting up essential components for a scalable, secure, and maintainable system. It includes pre-configured features that are critical for any production environment:

- Comprehensive logging for better traceability and debugging.
- Request monitoring to track and analyze incoming API calls.
- Request validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity.
- Basic unit tests for quick validation and maintainable code.
- Support for Spring Security available for robust authentication and authorization.
- External request templates to standardize API interactions with third-party services.
- Swagger UI for interactive API documentation and easy testing of endpoints.

This setup enables developers to focus on building core features without repeatedly configuring foundational aspects for production readiness.
